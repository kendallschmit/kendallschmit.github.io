        Test images for weird near-black behavior on LG UltraGear 32GS95UE
    </h1>

    <p>
    When toggling between the two screenshots, I see a slight
    brightening/dimming across all of the gray background. It's a bit subtle.
    A dark room is very helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
    Screenshots are designed to reproduce this behavior on factory default Gamer
    1 settings.
